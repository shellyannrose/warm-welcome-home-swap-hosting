**_Give your guests a welcome to write home about!_**

Your clients are world travelers who want to live like locals when they visit new places. You run a home swapping website that makes that possible, for a fraction of the housing cost. Your new client's next destination? The Yukon. So, she agrees to a swap of her home in Ireland for that of a Canadian who loves the poet, Yeats.

Now what?

## The problem: a host’s harried life  

A host's job is to prepare for guests and ensure that the home swap goes smoothly. This includes tracking:

* Who is coming
* When guests arrive and leave
* What tasks they must complete before guests arrive

Using spreadsheets or written notes to track this information creates more problems than they solve.

## The solution: a service for hosts to manage their guest stays

The Gracious Host makes it easy for hosts to give their guests a warm welcome. It is a cloud-based solution that has an API interface that is simple to use. When you add the Gracious Host to your site, your clients will enjoy the benefits of a service that:

* Simplifies the tracking of dates, times, tasks, and people
* Ensures that they are well-prepared for their guests
* Stores all hosting information in one place

## Resources and basic workflow

There are three resources:

* [Hosts](api/users.md) – This contains basic information about the host subscriber, like name and email address.
* [Guests](api/house_exchanges.md) – Once the host has a confirmed home swap, the host adds details about the guest. This resource stores guest details, like arrival date, number of guests, guest points usage, and so on.
* [Prep-checks](api/prep_checks.md) – The host then creates tasks for making the home ready. This includes cleaning rooms or buying utensils and food. This resource stores these tasks and alerts the host about a task’s due date.

## App integrations

Possible app integrations include:

* Hotel bookings
* Vacation (travel) bookings
* Rental property management

## API reference docs

Detailed descriptions of the service's resources.

The API reference docs refer to a `{server_url}` when they
refer to the URL of a resource. This is synonymous with `{base_url}`. Its value depends
on how you implement the service.

When running a local test, the `{base_url}` is
generally `http://localhost:3000`.

* [hosts resource](api/users.md)
* [guests resource](api/house_exchanges.md)
* [prep-checks resource](api/prep_checks.md)
